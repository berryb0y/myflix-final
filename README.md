# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# React App (myFlix)

## Objective

Using React, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to access information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## Essential View and Features

### Main View

- Returns a list of ALL movies to the user (each listed item with an image, title, and description)
- Sorting and filtering
- Ability to select a movie for more details

### Single Movie View

- Returns data (description, genre, director, image) about a single movie to the user
- Allows users to add a movie to their list of favorites

### Login View

- Allows users to log in with a username and password
- Registration view
- Allows new users to register (username, password, email, birthday)

### Genre View

- Returns data about a genre, with a name and description

## Technical Requirements

- The application must be a single-page application (SPA)
- The application must use state routing to navigate between views and share URLs
- The application must give users the option to filter movies
- The application must give users the option to sort movies
- The application must initially use Parcel as its build tool
